          <div id="top1">
            <p>
              Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
              Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
              River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
              number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
              rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

              Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and
              bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river
              corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
              tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter
              from sun or rain when needed.

              Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The
              Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States.
              As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in
              the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.
              There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who
              like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
              water more.

          <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
          <div id="center1">
            <p>
              Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
              desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
              Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful
              desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This
              84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just
              outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery,
              interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
              historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

              Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
              designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
              canyon tells.

          <div id="bottom1">
            <p>
              This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
              river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

              Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
              breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
              experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
              whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
              accessible only by river.

              CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale.
              The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
              accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
              However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
              rating scale, so we often refer to both.
