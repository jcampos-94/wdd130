        Basic
        [basic image]
        - Logo
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who are just starting and are looking for something simple but eye-catching. Perfect for a website, a sign, or a distinctive
        marking on your product packaging. This little guy can go anywhere and attract the attention of anyone whose eye it catches.

        [medium image]
        - Logo
        - Greeting Card
      </p>
      <p>
        For slowly growing businesses that need that extra push to reach more people. A logo is OK, but if you put it on a card with your name
        and contact information, it will be easier for your future customers to know how to find you. And if they do, you have good things coming
        your way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Premium
        [premium image]
        - Logo
        - Greeting Card
        - Facebook Banner
      </p>
      <p>
        For businesses looking to expand themselves beyond the reach of their local communities. Because what is better than a thriving business?
        One that develops and keeps growing! And nowadays, the best way to grow and reach everyone is through social media. A card can travel far
        distances, that's for sure, but the power of a 'Like' is beyond your wildest thoughts.

        Why hire us?
      </p>
      <p>
        - Because we know what it means to start from scratch with little resources and tons of struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Because we know how it feels when you can't reach your goal because people are unaware of your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Because we've been there when the prices for publicity and recognition were far more than we could pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        - And because we've experienced first-hand the joy of seeing our clients prosper after the extra push we could provide them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too good to be true?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just check our clients who started thriving after a simple logo or greeting card became part of their businesses.
        Many began to post their brand on social media and eventually started managing their own website! And just like that,
        a local bakery barely hanging out became a pillar of its community. At the same time, a couple in love with the desire
        to provide a romantic experience to other couples became the must-call business when looking to go out for dinner with your special one.
        That can be your dream becoming a reality as well!
