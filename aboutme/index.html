    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Juan. I'm sorry about the picture; it is the only one I have. (No, seriously, it is the only one)</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Web Developing. Until then, I earn a living as a graphical designer. I specialize mainly in logotypes, business cards, and invitations.</p>
    <p>As a hobby, I love to write short stories about anything that comes to mind: fantasy, mystery, sci-fi, you name it, I've written it all. Yet, the only ones that ended up being good were the sci-fi and horror ones.</p>
    <p>I am very excited about this course. Web development is something I have always wanted to learn about, and now I finally get the chance to do it. I hope it goes well for all of us.</p>
